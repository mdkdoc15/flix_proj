### Notes
When trying to make the collection view work the size of the cell was very tiny and squished together. I attemped to format the picture but nothing seemed to change the size. I reached out to Slack and was able to find out how to change the properties of my app to let me tell it what size I want the picture rather than have it be automatically assigned.
